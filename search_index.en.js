difference between the terms WebDriver and Selenium.\nWhen it comes to testing, these two terms WebDriver and Selenium are interchangeably used to refer the automating the web application.\nWebDriver is an HTTP based API to interact with a web browser. The standard is provided by W3C. WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of web browsers.\nSelenium is a range of tools and libraries that enable and support the automation of web browsers. Selenium WebDriver refers to both the language bindings and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code. This is commonly referred to as just WebDriver.\n\nMost of the browser vendors implements the W3C WebDriver capabilities and protocol on Selenium 3.8.0 (JSON wire protocol is OBSOLETE now) as a standalone server in a binary executable format.\n\n\n\nChrome\n\n\nFirefox\n\n\nOpera\n\n\nEDGE\n\n\n Selenium Architecture\n\nIn this article, we are going to see WebDriver API in action, for that we need to download ChromeDriver and PostMan tool.\n\nThe first step is to download the ChromeDriver executable. Download the appropriate driver version based on your OS.\nTo interact with the API we need a tool that allows us to make HTTP requests. For that we need to download the Postman tool. So that you can send and receive API requests.\nThe test case that we are going to automate as follow,\n\n\nOpen the Chrome browser\n\n\nNavigate to Google page\n\n\nFind search text box\n\n\nSend a search value\n\n\nFind the search button\n\n\nClick on the search button\n\n\nQuit driver\n\n\nLet’s first start ChromeDriver in Terminal\nExtract the file and run it using the command ./chromedriver. You will be given the port on which the WebDriver API is running.\n\n1. Open the Chrome browser\n{\n\"images\": [\n{\n\"src\": \"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2540/1*HX7JzMXo5R75qtkFTA4zhQ.png\",\n\"title\": \"Step 1\"\n},\n{\n\"src\": \"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*I3cVPlrRTp4_n9pylkQnRw.png\",\n\"title\": \"Step 2\"\n},\n{\n\"src\": \"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*O9gSQmtKsBafxdqHAQT0OQ.png\",\n\"title\": \"Step 3\"\n},\n{\n\"src\": \"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*faSnhxAkGGE6RIsYbw5PyQ.png\",\n\"title\": \"Step 4\"\n}\n]\n}\nNow that the chromedriver started in the default port 9519. Let's open the browser. This is done by creating a new session. To create a new session using the WebDriver API, make an HTTP POST request to the /session endpoint. In addition, we need to define the type of browser. This information is sent in as a JSON object in the POST body. On success, the response includes a sessionId.\n2. Navigate to Google page\n\nThe next step is to open a URL in the browser. This is done with an HTTP POST request to /session/&lt;session_id&gt;/url, with the POST body including the URL that will be opened\n3. Find search text box\n\n\n    \n    &nbsp; &nbsp;\n    \n\nNow that we have opened the Google page, let's find the search text box. This is done with an HTTP POST request to /session/&lt;session_id&gt;/element, with the POST body including the location strategy and selector\n4. Send a search value\n\nAfter locating the search box, let's send the search value. This is done with an HTTP POST request to /session/&lt;session_id&gt;/element/&lt;element_id&gt;/value, with the POST body including the value in the text parameter\n5. Find the search button\n\n\n    \n    &nbsp; &nbsp;\n    \n\nLet's find the search text button. This is done with an HTTP POST request to /session/&lt;session_id&gt;/element, with the POST body including the location strategy and selector\n6.

How it works ?\nIt is one of the Build automation tool from the Java community based on POM (project object model). It is an XML file that has information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.\n\nMaven build Lifecycle\nMaven build lifecycle goes through a series of stages, called as build phases. For example, the default lifecycle is\n\n\n\nvalidate — validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available. Also makes sure the dependencies are downloaded.\n\n\ncompile — compile the source code of the project.\n\n\ntest — runs the tests against the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed.\n\n\npackage — take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.\n\n\nverify — run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met.\n\n\ninstall — install the package into the local repository for use as a dependency in other projects locally deployed.\n\n\ndeploy — done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.\n\n\nThere are two other Maven lifecycles of note beyond the default list above. They are\n\n\nclean: cleans up artifacts created by prior builds\n\n\nsite: generates site documentation for this project\n\n\nThese phases executed sequentially when we run a maven build command.\nPOM file\n\n  \n\nLet’s break this POM file\nProject:\n&lt;project&gt; - is the root element and has the attributes XML namespace and Maven XML schema\n&lt;modelVersion&gt; - element defines the POM version, currently the only supported value is 4.0.0.\nGroupID, artifactID and version:\n&lt;groupId&gt; - element usually takes the unique ID of an organization, or a project. In this case I have used io.github.madhank93\n&lt;artifactId&gt; - element has the name of the project maventraining\n&lt;version&gt; - element contains the version number of the project 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\nThe above groupId and artifactId combination must be unique. Since this will be used in identifying the project in repository.\nPackage:\n&lt;packaging&gt; - which specifies the type of artifact the Maven should produce\nProperties:\nProperties are serves as a placeholder. These values can be accessed anywhere within a POM file. By using the notation ${element_name}or it can be used by plugins as default values\n&lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt; - it is a property recognized by Maven.\nPlugins:\nPlugins are where much of the real action is performed, plugins are used to: create jar files, create war files, compile code, unit test code, create project documentation, and on and on. Almost any action that you can think of performing on a project is implemented as a Maven plugin.\nIn this article I have used maven-compiler-plugin , this compiler plugin is used to compile the source code of a Maven project. By default, it compiles with Java 5. We can manage the settings in configuration element, in this case, it is instructed to build artifacts to compatible with Java 1.8.\nDependencies:\nThere are two types of Maven dependencies:\n\n\nDirect: These dependencies defined in your pom.xml file under the  section.\n\n\nTransitive: These are dependencies required by our direct dependencies\n\n\n&lt;dependencies&gt; - this tag specifies the additional libraries that are needed for the project\n&lt;scope&gt; - element indicates this dependency is only applicable for the testing phase of the Maven lifecycle.\nMaven central repository is the default location to download all the dependent libraries. One of the dependency that used is in this article is selenium-java.\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n\nReferences\n[1] https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html\n[2] https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html\n[3] https://www.baeldung.com/maven\n[4] http://tutorials.jenkov.com/maven/maven-tutorial.html\n","id":" /blogs/002-build-tool/","title":"What are build automation tool ?

Leveraging the cross-browser power of Selenoid, by running it on the GitHub Actions and publishing the test results to GitHub pages.\n\nWebdriverIO is a next-gen browser and mobile automation test framework for Node.js\n\nIt is what they say, truly an open-source framework that can be used to automated modern web applications as well as native and cross-platform mobile applications.\nIt comes with a lot of add-on services, to name a few, Google lighthouse integration, DevTools service (leverages Chrome DevTools protocol), Appium service and Visual regression testing service. Check the complete list of services provided by WebdriverIO here under the services section.\n\nSelenoid is a lightning fast Selenium protocol implementation running browsers in Docker containers\n\nIt is an open-source solution for running all your test scripts on a cross-browser platform. Easy installation, relatively fast, ready to use browser images, live browser execution with logs, and video recordings.\n\nGitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows\n\nCurrently, it has 8K+ actions in the Github market. It is easy to configure, all the action files are written using YAML syntax, supports multiple programming languages and major OS, matrix builds, secure way to managing all your secret keys.\nInstallation\nNow that we have seen all the benefits, let’s get started with an installation process. Installing a WebdriverIO is very straight forward. All you need to do is initialise npm by doing\n\nAfter initialising the npm, execute the following to install wdio cli package.\n\nAfter the installation of CLI, execute the below command to configure the wdio, which will ask you a series of questions to get started.\n\n\nIn addition to this, we need to include tsconfig.json , auto compile and browser configuration details to wdio.conf.ts file.\nWorkflow walkthrough\nNow that everything has set up let’s look into the GitHub actions yml file. And go through every step.\nStep 1: Starting the selenoid server\n\nStep 2: Checkout the code\n\nStep 3: Setup the node env\n\nStep 4: Install the dependencies\n\nStep 5: Run wdio test scripts\n\nStep 6: Get the allure history\n\nStep 7: Setup allure report\n\nStep 8: Deploy the report to the GitHub pages\n\nConclusion:\nSo whenever the code has been merged to the main branch the above workflow will be triggered and test results are published to GitHub pages. The benefits of having such CI pipelines in place helps to identify if anything was broken by the recent changes. And the main advantage of running UI tests in cross-browser environments assists in avoiding compatibility issues in the end.\nNote: The above workflow should be triggered whenever there is a PR raised against the branch. But due to the crypto-mining attacks, I have not configured pull request flow for this repo.\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n🌟 🌟 🌟 The source code for this blog post can be found here 🌟🌟🌟\nGitHub - madhank93/wdio-ts-github-actions\nReport link\n\n","id":" /blogs/006-github-actions-selenoid/","title":"Github Actions for Seleniod Test Scripts"}," /blogs/007-wdio-in-containers/":{"body":"\nAs we looked at how to run test automation scripts in selenoid using 3rd party add-on actions in my previous blog. In this blog let’s dive into how to containerize WebdriverIO test automation scripts, and set up a Selenoid environment using Docker to run in local and CI environments.\nThe main advantage of choosing docker over any 3rd party add-on is it enables users to package an application into containers — standardized executable components that combine application source code with all the dependencies required to run the code in any environment.\nSetup process\nLet’s start this process by creating a Dockerfile, which is a text document that contains all the commands to build an image, docker can build an image automatically by reading the instructions present in the docker file.\n\n  \n\nThe above Dockerfile will install the necessary packages and includes all the test automation source code.\nNow let's create a Docker Compose file.

In this blog let’s dive into how to run WebdriverIO test automation scripts in scalable mode using Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Build.\nKubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Google Kubernetes Engine — provides a simple way to automatically deploy, scale, and manage Kubernetes. And Cloud Build — it is a serverless CI/CD platform to build, test, and deploy.\nAccording to the documentation of Aerokube, selenoid is not recommended for the Kubernetes platform. And Moon is pay per use model. So in this article, we are going to explore Selenosis — a scalable, stateless selenium hub for the Kubernetes cluster.\nSelenosis setup walkthrough\n1. Creating a namespace\nNamespaces are Kubernetes objects which help in organising resources and partition a single Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters. It provides a degree of isolation from the other parts of the cluster.\n\n2. Creating service for selenosis\nService is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. It creates a permanent IP address, the lifecycle of pod and service are not connected. Even if the pods crash and are recreated, the service IP remains the same.\n\n  \n\n3. Creating selenosis deployment\nDeployment describes the desired state of a pod or a replica set, then gradually updates the environment (for example, creating or deleting replicas) until the current state matches the desired state specified in the deployment file. In general, we don’t work directly with pods, we will create deployments. It is mainly for stateless apps.\n\n  \n\n4. Selenosis HPA\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of Pods in a replication controller, deployment, replica set or stateful set based on observed CPU utilisation\n\n  \n\n5. Other configs\n\n\nBelow is the command to convert the browser yaml file into ConfigMap\nkubectl create cm selenosis-config --from-file=browsers.yaml=selenosis-deploy/browsers.yaml -n selenosis\n\n\nUse core-dns.yaml to turn off the DNS caching for the selenosis namespace\n\n\nUse pre-pull-image.yaml to pre pull the chrome and firefox browser images\n\n\nTo debug use selenoid-ui.yaml ***which enables the UI feature to debug\n\n\nContainerizing test scripts\nJobs used to run a finite task(which is a suitable k8s object to use for running test scripts). It will create one or more Pods and performs a given task. Once the task is completed successfully, the pod will be exited.\n\n  \n\nCreating a project in GCP\nCreate a new project in GCP, go to Cloud Build, enable the api. And few other settings as shown in the below picture (to follow along with this tutorial you need a cloud billing account, a *free tier* is sufficient). And make sure you have the required permissions in the IAM &amp; Admin section.\n\n\nSetting up Cloud build\nGo to Cloud Build &gt; Triggers section, click on Create Trigger and add the details as follow. So whenever the code has been pushed to GitHub, cloud build flow will be triggered.\n\n\n\nAnd finally creating cloudbuild.yml file to execute the process of building docker image from source code (e2e), pushing it to a container registry, creating a GKE cluster and finally starting e2e tests.\n\n\n  \n\nExecution\nAccording to the cloud build settings, whenever the code has been pushed to Github repositories, execution will begin.\n\n\n\nResult\nRunning all the 25 spec/tests files in chrome and firefox browsers parallelly, and completing it all within well under 04:41 mins. More or less time remains constant since all the tests are running in parallel no matter how many tests scripts has been authored, maximum time will take to complete the whole process will the slowest of all the test.\n\n⚠️❗⚠️ Finally make sure to delete the GKE cluster and Container images to avoid any charges.\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n🌟 🌟 🌟 The source code for this blog post can be found here 🌟🌟🌟\nGitHub - madhank93/wdio-gke-cloud-build\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://github.com/alcounit/selenosis\n[2] https://github.com/alcounit/selenosis-deploy\n[3] https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/gitops-cloud-build\n[4] https://codefresh.io/kubernetes-tutorial/single-use-daemonset-pattern-pre-pulling-images-kubernetes/\n","id":" /blogs/008-scaling-tests-gke-gitops/","title":"Scaling tests on Google Kubernetes Engine with Cloud Build"}," /blogs/009-containerized-android-test/":{"body":"\nIn the previous blog we looked at running web automation tests using selenoid in Docker and Kubernetes. This time we are going to look at running containerized android tests in GCP using Pulumi and Selenoid.\nPulumi is a modern Infrastructure as Code platform that allows you to use familiar programming languages and tools to build, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure. Selenoid is a lightning fast Selenium protocol implementation running on browsers and android emulator in Docker containers.\n\nTo get started with Pulumi and GCP, please refer to this article. It includes installation and environment setup.\n\n\nTotally there are 3 parts to this article,\n\n\nEnvironment setup in GCP,\n\n\nRunning Selenoid containers, and\n\n\nContainerizing Android tests and executing it\n\n\nEnvironment setup in GCP\nIn order to run selenoid android containers we need a Linux server with nested virtualization enabled. So we will use Pulumi to build infrastructure setup in GCP. One thing to keep in mind is that not every machine type in GCP supports nested virtualization; for more info refer to this article.\n\n  \n\ndeploy.sh file contains scripts to install docker and docker compose in the GCP remote instance.\nRunning Selenoid containers\nPulumi docker provider packaged is used to run the containers in GCP instance.\n\n  \n\nContainerizing android tests and executing it\nTo demonstrate I have used Sauce Labs swag app using Java to automate the login process. Containerized the test scripts using docker multi stage build.\nRemote address\n\nThe android automation test scripts should point to the above URL. If the test application is also deployed as part of a docker container.\n\nIf you want your setup to be in GCP and run tests from the local machine, all we need is to change the above URL to point to the External IP address.\nSpecifying capabilities\n\nOne thing to notice here is that rather than providing the local path of the APK file, I have specified the URL. Because the local path of the APK does not exist inside the container or else you have to bind mount the APK file.

We will use Telegraf to transform selenosis metrics, Prometheus to collect metrics and visualize it using Grafana.\n\n\nPrometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, stores its metrics as time series data in Time series Database (TSDB)\n\n\nTelegraf is an open-source agent for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics\n\n\nGrafana is an open-source data-visualization platform\n\n\nMonitoring Setup\n\n\nTo follow along with this article, do checkout the source code and\nuse minikube or kind or any self-hosted/managed k8s cluster.\n\nInstall Prometheus to collect metrics\nRecommended way of installing Prometheus in k8s cluster is using helm charts.\n\nOnce the deployments are successful, port forward to access the Prometheus UI on the browser at http://localhost:9090\n\nSetup Selenosis test infrastructure\nPlease refer to the detailed instructions of setting up test infrastructure in this article. In short, execute the shell script sh infra/selenosis/script.sh from the root folder to complete the test infra setup.\nOnce the script has been successfully executed and pods are up &amp; running, port forward to see the selenosis status at http://localhost:4000/status, usage of selenosis metrics is available in JSON format.\n\nConverting to Prometheus understandable metrics\nSince Selenosis is a 3rd party application and doesn’t have /metrics endpoint exposed to scrape metrics. And also, Prometheus doesn’t understand metrics that are in JSON format, so we will use Telegraf plugins to convert JSON into Prometheus understandable data format.\n\nAnd also there are a number of libraries and servers which help in exporting existing metrics from third-party systems as Prometheus metrics.\n\n\n\nExecute the below commands to apply manifests files of telegraf to setup it up in k8s cluster.\n\nNow apply the following k8s manifest file so that Prometheus operator can pick up telegraf service monitor _and add it to the scraping targets. _(Basically, operator takes cares most of creation/deletion/reload config of k8s app lifecycle, for more info refer here)\n\nQuerying Prometheus metrics using PromQL\nPrometheus offers the PromQL, using which we can select and aggregate time series data in real time.\n\nSelenosis exposes http_selenosis_active , http_selenosis_pending , http_selenosis_total and these metrics are of gauge type (in which metrics can go up and down). And Prometheus supports four types of metrics in total.\nStart executing the tests to see selenosis metrics usage in prometheus by executing the following command in the terminal.\n\nVisualizing metrics in Grafana\nGrafana comes as part of the Prometheus helm installation, no additional setup is required and also it supports the PromQL out of the box. To access the Grafana UI, port forward the incoming request and access it on the browser at http://localhost:3000/status\n\n\nFrom the above dashboard we track the usage metrics of Selenosis. When it started pending-0 , active-0 &amp; total-10 remains the same and as soon as the test started executing active count increased to 3. Since no. of parallel execution is set to 3 in the testing framework. Once the tests are completed, the active count drops to zero.\nThis article shows a simple use-case of collecting and visualizing of Selenosis usage metrics. Kube state metric comes as part of the Prometheus helm installation and it currently supports about 35+ resources. So, start building your dashboards in Grafana.\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n🌟 🌟 🌟 The source code for this blog post can be found here 🌟🌟🌟\nGitHub - madhank93/monitoring-test-automation\n\nReferences:\n[1] TechWorld with Nana — Prometheus series Part 1 Part 2\n[2] https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/\n[3] https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.23/\n[4] https://grafana.com/docs/\n[5] https://prometheus-operator.dev/\n[6] https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/#_advanced_features\n","id":" /blogs/010-mointoring-tests/","title":"Monitoring Test automation: Gathering metrics — Part 1"}," /blogs/011-lld-parking-lot-part-1/":{"body":"\nIn this article, we are going to focus on how to approach a given problem statement using the following steps.\n\n\nUnderstand the system requirements and constraints.\n\n\nIdentify the objects in a system.\n\n\nEstablish relationships between objects, and\n\n\nImplement based on Object-Oriented principles\n\n\nUnderstanding requirements:\nLet’s take a look at the system requirements for creating a Parking lot system.\n\nHow to approach the problem statement ?\nThe next step is to convert those requirements into design diagrams to get a better understanding of the system we are going to develop.

It allows for securely managing identities and providing access to AWS services and resources.\n\nHow does it work?\nWith AWS — Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS by using the following components.\n\n1. Users:\nUsers represent individual entities (like people, applications, or services within AWS) that can interact with your AWS resources like EC2 instances or S3 buckets. Each user is assigned a unique username and access credentials (password or access keys) for authentication.\n2. Groups:\nGroups are collections of users (eg: Dev group or QA group). Assigning permissions to groups makes it easier than managing access for multiple users with similar roles or responsibilities. This simplifies the process of granting and revoking permissions across multiple users.\n3. Roles:\nRoles are similar to users, but they are not associated with a specific identity. Instead, roles are assumed by resources, such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, EKS cluster, or applications running on Azure. This enables these resources to access other AWS services securely without needing long-term credentials.\n4. Permissions:\nPermissions define what actions are allowed or denied to access AWS resources. By default, all the permissions are denied. Permissions are managed through policies, which are JSON documents that outline the permissions in a structured way. Policies can be attached to users, groups, and roles.\n\n5. Policies:\nA policy is a document that defines permissions in a granular manner. AWS provides managed policies that cover common use cases, and custom policies also can be created. Policies can be attached at various levels (user, group, role, or resource) to control access.\n\nOne of the main advantage of using IAM services is helping us to grant least privilege access or granting only the permissions required to perform a task\n\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n\nReference:\n[1] https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\n","id":" /blogs/014-aws-iam/","title":"AWS services — Identity Access Management (IAM)"}," /blogs/015-prod-eks-part-2/":{"body":"\nAs a continuation of my previous blog series on production-level EKS cluster setup, in this, we are going to see how to create an AWS EKS cluster using Terraform.\nTerraform is an open-source infrastructure tool to provision and manage infrastructure in any cloud.

It is the main way to package and reuse resource configurations. For this article, we’ll make use of VPC and EKS created and maintained by the community.\n\n\nWorkspaces — Each state file (.tfstate) stored in the backend belongs to a workspace.

Ansible is a configuration management tool, that helps you to install and manage software on existing cloud infrastructure.\n\nLet’s begin by creating the cloud resources in AWS using Pulumi in Python language.\ni. Getting .ssh key content\nReading SSH keys and these keys will be used later to create an EC2 key pair for SSH access to the instances.\n\nii. Creating a VPC\nVPCs provide network isolation, security, and control over the cloud resources, allowing to define the network architecture of an application. The below code creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16 and enables DNS support.\n\niii. Creating a Subnet in an Availability Zone\nAvailability Zone is a data center or isolated location within a region. AWS has multiple AZs within each region, physically separated to provide redundancy and resiliency. A subnet is a range of IP addresses allocated from the VPC range. And subnets are associated with specific Availability Zones (AZs) in a region.\nIt creates a subnet within this VPC range using the first availability zone returned by get_availability_zones() . The below CIDR range of the subnet 10.0.0.0/16 can host up to 251 ec2 instances.\n\niv. Setting up an Internet gateway and Route table\nInternet gateway provisions the resources within the VPC to access the internet. Route tables help to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed. A route is added to the route table to direct all traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet Gateway.\n\nv. Configuring Security group rules\nEgress rules are used to control the outbound traffic; traffic generated by AWS resources (such as ec2 instances) and sent out from VPC to the internet or the other networks. Below egress rules allow services to connect to any IP address, on any port, using any protocol (“-1” means all protocols)\nIngress rules are used to control the inbound traffic; traffic from the outside world entering into the AWS network. Below ingress rules allows all protocols &amp; all ports from 10.0.0.0/16 and 10.200.0.0/16 for internal communication and access for ssh-22, https-443, and kube-api-server-6443\n\nvi. Load balancer and target group\nLoad balancer (NLB) is used to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple targets, in this case, it will be directed to IP addresses, and attaching the target group instructs the load balancer to distribute traffic to the IP addresses specified target_id within the target group specified by target_group.arn. The below snippet receives the income request and forwards it to the 6443 port to the controller instances where kube-api-server listens.\n\nvii. Get the latest Amazon machine image\nBelow snippet of code retrieves the most recent Ubuntu 20.04 AMI owned by Amazon.\n\nviii. Instance creation\nThe below helper function is used to create six EC2 instances (three workers and three controllers) in the subnet, with the security group attached to it. The instances are configured with user data for identifying their roles and private IP addresses.\n\nix.

It uses a mesh networking approach, enabling encrypted peer-to-peer connections, each device can connect directly to other devices within the network, without needing a central server to route traffic.\nHow does Tailscale Mesh VPN work?\n\n\nA traditional VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and a centralized VPN server hub. This tunnel allows your internet traffic to travel securely through the server, masking your IP address and encrypting your data.\n\nTailscale uses a mesh VPN architecture, allowing direct, peer-to-peer connections between devices without a central VPN server. The Tailscale coordination server is used for authentication, key exchange, and device discovery. Once devices are authenticated and have discovered each other, they establish direct, peer-to-peer connections using Wireguard.\n\nTailscale supports many devices (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android), and the installation process is pretty straightforward.\nSo how does it allow accessing geo-restricted content?\n\n\nOne of the many features of Tailscale is Exit nodes, an exit node is a device within the Tailscale network that routes traffic to the broader internet on behalf of other devices in the network. This is useful for scenarios where you want to use a specific network’s internet connection, such as accessing region-specific content or securing internet traffic through a trusted network.\nReferences:\n[1] https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works\n[2] https://tailscale.com/learn/understanding-mesh-vpns\n[3] https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works\n[4] https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes\n","id":" /blogs/021-tailscale-geo-content/","title":"Unlocking geo-restricted contents with Tailscale"}," /blogs/022-storing-secrets-part-1/":{"body":"\nSecrets (passwords, tokens, keys, …etc) are critical components in software and infrastructure that provide access to sensitive data and services. So the next crucial part is securing it, secrets can be stored on the Client — on the device running the application (e.g. hardcoded passwords in your codebase) or on the Server — on the centralized application retrieving over an API call (e.g. fetching from AWS secrets manager or Infisical or Hashicorp vault) or using OpenID Connect (OIDC) to issue short-lived access tokens instead of managing passwords. All approaches have their pros and cons.\nIn this blog post, we will take a look at how to store secrets on the client side securely — git using SOPS (Secrets OPerationS), a CLI tool used for encrypting, and decrypting the files with AWS KMS (supports GCP KMS, Age, Azure Key Vault ..etc).\nTo get started install SOPS binary from GitHub, complete AWS configuration, and KMS key creation.\nHow does it work?\nThe sops command takes a file to encrypt it along with the encryption keys and produces a decrypted file. By default, it encryps only the values leaving the keys as it is for easy readability.\n\nSOPS uses AWS SDK to communicate with AWS KMS. It makes use of the credentials configured from ~/.aws/credentials.\nSOPS configuration\nConfigurations related to SOPS can be maintained in .sops.yaml file. Different sets of keys can be used in various environments to encrypt files and what files to encrypt or decrypt. And also its supports encrypted_regex option will only encrypt values under keys that match the supplied regular expression.\n\nSOPS as an editor\nTo get started run sops new_test.dev.yaml, opens up the text editor (whatever $EDITOR is set to, or, if it's not vim is the default) which handles encryption/decryption. Delete the preconfigured ones, and add the key value (e.g. password: secret!!!) to be encrypted, save &amp; exit the editor. As soon as we exit the editor, a new file named new_test.dev.yaml created with encryption and SOPS metadata.\n\nEncrypting and decrypting an existing file\nTo encrypt the existing file, run sops -e -i db-secrets.dev.yml and write the output back to the same file. To decrypt the file, run sops -d -i db-secrets.dev.yml\n\nKey Rotation\nAs a good practice, it is always recommended to rotate the key and re-encrypt the file with a new key using the command sops roatet -i filename.yml after updating the .sops.yaml file with a new key.\nUse cases\n\n\nConfig management for applications\n\n\nManaging Kubernetes secrets and helm\n\n\nEncrypting Terraform/Pulumi state files\n\n\nOther features\n\n\nAudit— keeps track of who accessed what files in PostgreSQL\n\n\nPublish— publishes a file to a pre-configured destination like s3\n\n\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n🌟 🌟 🌟 The source code for this blog post can be found here 🌟🌟🌟\nGitHub - madhank93/learn-securing-secrets\n\nReference:\n\n\nhttps://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html\n\n\nhttps://getsops.io/\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/Usage\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAHWp_qqCrKRQXPcnfEd4Cim1cL6MTjT\n\n\n","id":" /blogs/022-storing-secrets-part-1/","title":"Securely storing secrets — Part I"}," /blogs/023-resume-typst-template/":{"body":"\nIn this blog, we will look at how to create beautiful resumes using Typst.

Using Nginx Ingress Controller for routing traffic, Cert Manager to automatically provision and manage TLS certificates with Let’s Encrypt, and Cloudflare for DNS services. This setup allows you to securely expose your applications to the internet with a custom domain.\n\nInfrastructure Setup\nI previously written an article, creating a Proxmox server using Pulumi. In this, I’ve made one significant change — instead of using MetalLB for load balancing, I’ve opted for kube-vip, which provides both control plane and service load balancing capabilities.\nBelow is the configuration for the Kubernetes cluster,\n\nThe main benefit of using kube-vip is that we get load balancing for both the control plane and services in a single solution. When configuring kube-vip, it’s critical to provide unused IP addresses in the address range. You can identify available IPs in your home network using the NMAP\n\nAfter building the infrastructure with Pulumi and setting up Kubernetes with Kubespray, it is time to deploy Super Mario.\nDeploying Super Mario\nFor Super Mario deployment, we’ll be using kustomize with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and a ClusterIP service. The Kubernetes manifests for this application include:\n\n\nA Deployment resource that runs the Super Mario container\n\n\nA Service resource that exposes the game on port 8080\n\n\nAn HPA to automatically scale based on CPU utilization\n\n\nOnce the deployment is complete, you can test the application locally using port forwarding.\n\nNavigate to localhost:8080 in your browser to verify the game is running correctly.\nInstalling Nginx Ingress Controller\nThe Nginx Ingress Controller acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer for the Kubernetes services. It will route external traffic to Super Mario game. It can be installed using Helm.\n\nNote: we’re setting the loadBalancerIP to an address within our kube-vip address range.\nSetting Up DNS with Cloudflare\nTo make Super Mario game accessible via a custom domain, need to create a DNS record pointing to our Nginx Ingress Controller’s IP address.\n\n\n\nLog into your Cloudflare dashboard\n\n\nNavigate to the DNS management section for your domain\n\n\nCreate an A record (e.g., mario.yourdomain.com) pointing to 192.168.1.205\n\n\nEnsure the “Proxy status” is turned OFF (use DNS only mode)\n\n\nThis direct DNS mapping is essential because we’re running in a homelab environment.\nCreating a Cloudflare API Token\nFor Let’s Encrypt to automatically verify domain ownership and issue certificates, we need to create a Cloudflare API token.\n\n\n\nLog into your Cloudflare dashboard\n\n\nNavigate to “My Profile” &gt; “API Tokens”\n\n\nClick on “Create Token”\n\n\nSelect the “Edit zone DNS” template\n\n\nEnsure “Zone” &gt; “DNS” &gt; “Edit” permission is included\n\n\nSpecify your domain in the “Zone Resources” section\n\n\nClick “Continue to summary” and then “Create Token”\n\n\nCopy and securely store the token that appears — it will only be shown once\n\n\nConfiguring Certificate Management\nLet’s Encrypt provides free TLS certificates that can be used to secure the Super Mario game. First, create a Kubernetes secret with your Cloudflare API token.\n\nNext, create a ClusterIssuer to handle certificate provisioning. We’ll use the DNS-01 challenge since our homelab isn’t directly accessible from the internet (which would be required for HTTP-01 challenges).\n\nExposing Super Mario with Ingress\nFinally, create an Ingress resource to expose the Super Mario game to the internet with TLS encryption.\n\nVerifying the Deployment\nAfter applying all configurations, you should be able to access your Super Mario game securely via your custom domain (e.g., https://mario.yourdomain.com). You can verify the certificate status with:\n\nThe status should show “Ready” once Let’s Encrypt has issued the certificate.\nTroubleshooting\nIf you encounter issues, check the following:\n\n\nEnsure your Cloudflare API token has the correct permissions\n\n\nVerify that the DNS record is properly configured in Cloudflare\n\n\nCheck the cert-manager logs for any errors kubectl logs -n cert-manager -l app=cert-manager\n\n\nConfirm that your Ingress Controller is properly receiving traffic\n\n\n\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n🌟 🌟 🌟 The source code for this blog post can be found here 🌟🌟🌟\nGitHub - madhank93/homelab\n\nReference:\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpovOI5eK58&amp;t=2679s\n[2] https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx\n[3] https://cert-manager.io/docs/\n[4] https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/\n","id":" /blogs/031-supermario-on-proxmox-k8s/","title":"Running Super Mario on Kubernetes in a Proxmox Homelab"}," /blogs/032-nvidia-gpu-part-1/":{"body":"\nWhen I set out to upgrade my refurbished Dell Precision 7820 tower for AI workloads, I needed serious GPU computing power.

This card plugs into the server and adds Thunderbolt capability, which is needed for high-speed external GPU use.\nImportant BIOS settings\nOnce the hardware was ready, I had to tweak some settings in the BIOS.\n\n\nTurn on Thunderbolt support.\n\n\nSet Thunderbolt security to “User Authorization” (or “No Security” if you want fewer connection prompts).\n\n\nSet PCIe Bus Allocation to “Optimize for Thunderbolt.”\n\n\nRight cable\nAt first, I tried using a regular USB-C cable to connect the dock. It didn’t work well — the GPU kept disconnecting or wasn’t detected at all. Turns out, you must use a Thunderbolt-certified cable for this setup. Once I switched to the Thunderbolt cable that came with the dock, everything worked perfectly.\n\nA vGPU, or virtual GPU, is a technology that allows a physical GPU to be split into virtual instances, enabling multiple virtual machines (VMs) to share graphics card. However, this feature is officially supported only on Nvidia’s enterprise-grade GPUs and is not available for consumer models like the RTX series. For homelab users, the alternative is PCIe tunneling (passthrough), which assigns the entire GPU to a single VM at a time — without sharing it across multiple VM.\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n\nReference:\n[1] https://aoostar.com/collections/egpu-series\n[2] https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/\n","id":" /blogs/032-nvidia-gpu-part-1/","title":"Making my homelab server AI ready with Nvidia GPU — Part I"}," /blogs/033-nvidia-gpu-part-2/":{"body":"\nSince my previous post on GPU passthrough in Proxmox using Pulumi, I’ve made a significant improvements in my homelab automation stack. This blog post covers the migration to the latest Ubuntu image, kernel upgrades, enhanced cloud-init automation, and the usage of workflow using justfile.\nUpgrading to the latest Kernel\nThe most notable change is the adoption of the Ubuntu 24.04 cloud image as the default VM template. This ensures improved hardware compatibility, and optimal support for AI workloads. The config.yml file now points directly to the official Ubuntu 24.04 cloud image.\n\nThis change makes sures that all new VMs will boot with the latest LTS release and kernel, which is essential for modern NVIDIA drivers.\nEnhanced cloud-init\nThe cloud-init configuration has been modified to include,\n\n\nNVIDIA driver auto install: The runcmd section now leverages ubuntu-drivers autoinstall for automatic NVIDIA driver installation, ensuring GPU-enabled VMs are ready for AI workloads.\n\n\nKernel and header installation: The script ensures the latest kernel and headers are present.\n\n\nCentralized configuration\nTo streamline the deployment process, all environment specific settings are now centralized in config.yml (for cluster and node definitions) and .env (for sensitive data like passwords) added to gitignore. Pulumi code dynamically loads these configurations at runtime.\n\n\nconfig.yml: Stores Proxmox credentials, endpoint, node name, and image URL.\n\n\n.env: Holds secrets such as the Proxmox password.\n\n\nVM creation with GPU passthrough\nWhen provisioning a VM that requires GPU access, the Pulumi Go code dynamically adjusts the VM specification. By setting HasGPU: true and specifying PCIe IDs, the correct passthrough configuration is automatically applied during provisioning.\n\nAutomation with justfile\nUsing a Justfile allows you to define repeatable commands,\n\n\n\njust up – Deploy or update the cluster\n\n\njust destroy – Tear down all the resources\n\n\nOutput\nThe output of nvidia-smi confirms NVIDIA GPUs are correctly detected and operational within the VM. This utility provides real-time details on GPU status, driver versions, memory usage, and running processes.\n\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n🌟 🌟 🌟 The source code for this blog post can be found here 🌟🌟🌟\nGitHub - madhank93/homelab\n\nReference:\n[1] https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/PCI_Passthrough\n[2] https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvidia-smi/index.html\n[3] https://just.systems/man/en/\n","id":" /blogs/033-nvidia-gpu-part-2/","title":"Making my homelab server AI ready with Nvidia GPU — Part II"}," /blogs/034-nvidia-gpu-k8s/":{"body":"\nIn my previous article I talked about configuring GPU in VM level in Proxmox using GPU passthrough. However, the ultimate goal was to make this capability available to containerized workloads. In this post, I’ll walk you through on setting up the GPU enabled capability in the Kubernetes cluster.\nPre-flight check:\nTo ensure secure and automated access to the newly provisioned VMs, password authentication for the default ubuntu user has been disabled and now it relies on SSH keys. Before deployment, update the cloud-init.yml file with own public SSH key. This cloud-init configuration automatically adds key to the VM upon creation, allowing to connect securely without a password.\nUpdating cluster inventory\nInventory file has been simplified with the recent changes to accommodate the following features.\n\n\n\nhas_gpu=true custom variable that acts as a flag\n\n\nnode_labels applies a label to the node\n\n\nDynamic networking configuration\nGPU node uses a different network interface name enp6s18 than the other nodes ens18. Because kube-vip maintains high availability, which needs to know the correct interface on each node.\nInstead of a static configuration, a dynamic solution is implemented in values.yml file using a Jinja2 template.\n\nIt checks for the has_gpu variable defined in the inventory file and Ansible automatically assigns the correct network interface for Kube-VIP on each nodes.\nDeployment with Docker and Justfile\nTo improve consistency and simplify the deployment process, I’ve containerized the Kubespray execution using Docker. And to manage the Docker command, I’ve adopted a Justfile.\n\nNow, setting up the entire cluster deployment is reduced to a single command just run-kubespray.\nCluster verification\nAfter Kubespray successfully sets up cluster, configure kubectl on local machine. Copy the admin.conf file from a control plane node to local ~/.kube/config.\n\nNext, edit ~/.kube/config file. Find the server address and replace it with the load balancer IP defined in Kubespray values.yml file (e.g., https://192.168.1.10:6443). This ensures commands are sent to the highly-available endpoint instead of a single node.\n\nMake sure all the nodes are joined by running the following command kubectl get nodes --show-labels\nInstalling NVIDIA GPU operator\nThe NVIDIA GPU Operator automates the management of all the necessary software components to provision GPUs in Kubernetes, including drivers, container runtimes, and monitoring tools . The easiest way to install it is with Helm.\n\nNext, install the operator in a dedicated namespace.\n\nThis command deploys the operator, which will then automatically detect the GPU on the labeled worker node and installs all the necessary drivers and plugins.\nVerifying GPU Integration\nDescribe the node and look for nvidia.com/gpu in the labels and nvidia.com/gpu under the Allocatable resources section.\n\nShould see an output similar to this.\n\nTo confirm that everything is working, run a simple test pod that requests GPU resources and executes the nvidia-smi command.\nCreate a file named gpu-test.yaml with the following content.\n\nDeploying the pod\n\nAfter a few moments, check the logs of the pod.\n\nIf the installation was successful, the output will be the familiar nvidia-smi report, showing the details of the GPU, but this time generated from within a Kubernetes pod . With these changes, my homelab is now fully equipped to run GPU-accelerated workloads directly within Kubernetes.\n\nFinal thoughts\nThis post demonstrates how to build a Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox using a mutable infrastructure model. Future goal is to explore an immutable setup and I plan to experiment with Talos to achieve this.\n* * * *\n\nOriginally published on Medium\n🌟 🌟 🌟 The source code for this blog post can be found here 🌟🌟🌟\nGitHub - madhank93/homelab at v0.1.4\n\nReference:\n[1] https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/index.html#\n[2] https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#_cpu_type\n[3] https://kubespray.io/#/docs/ansible/inventory\n[4] https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/what-is-mutable-vs-immutable-infrastructure\n","id":" /blogs/034-nvidia-gpu-k8s/","title":"Adding Nvidia GPU boost to Proxmox k8s using Pulumi and Kubespray"}," /blogs/035-gpt-oss-k8s-ollama/":{"body":"\nFollowing up on the previous article about setting up a home lab with AI capabilities, in this article we will cover the practical steps of running a large language model gpt-oss on a Kubernetes cluster using Ollama and all running within a Proxmox environment.\nSetting up Ollama\nThe deployment of Ollama within a k8s environment is simplified by using the otwld/ollama helm chart.
