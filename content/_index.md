<h2 align="center"> Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif?raw=true" width="30px"> I am Madhan </h2>

<div align="center">
<p>
I have 8+ plus years of experience in providing information about the quality of the product under development, regardless of where in development that product is. An ambitious person who wants to be a part of all the phases in the Software development cycle.
    
In the daytime, I read the specs, create test cases, validate API, develop an automation framework, write scripts to automate, analyze performance, and occasionally perform a security audit for the product. In the nighttime, I develop android applications using Flutter, learning to integrate and write cloud functions in firebase and trying to play some strings.
