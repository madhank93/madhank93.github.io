In continuation of my [previous article](https://medium.com/@madhankumaravelu93/low-level-system-design-parking-lot-design-part-i-7567d510da1d), in this post we will look at the code implementation of the Parking lot system, which was solved using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programming language, and following [Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) unit test framework.

### Vehicle:

![Vehicle spot implementation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*fgApaaeWq1SK7DAsQD7AzA.png)

- **Vehicle** class contains all the common behaviours which are applicable to other vehicles like in this example **MotorCycle** and **Car**

### _Parking spot:_

![Parking spot implementation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*oLG4lKNhcTNBmYzbK7AajQ.png)

- **ParkingSpot** class contains all the common behaviours which are applicable to other Spots like in this example **CarSpot** and **MotorcycleSpot**

### Parking floor:

![Parking floor implementation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2066/1*G09eFX0yvxnmsedzHE92gg.png)

- **ParkingFloor** class has the access to parking spots and display board.

- The **getSpotTypeForVehicle** private method determines which ParkingSpot should be mapped to a given vehicle.

### Parking lot:

- The **ParkingLot** class serves as the system's entry point.

- The **ParkingLot** class is declared using the singleton pattern, which limits class initialization to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created.
