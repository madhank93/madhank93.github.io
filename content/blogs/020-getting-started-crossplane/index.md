In this blog post, we are going to look at how to create an AWS Cloud resource S3 bucket using [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/).

### What is Crossplane ?

[Crossplane.io](https://www.crossplane.io/) is an open-source, CNCF project built on the foundation of Kubernetes to orchestrate applications and infrastructures using a [declarative approach](https://www.linode.com/blog/devops/declarative-vs-imperative-in-iac/). It is a framework for creating Control Planes by following principles of the [Kubernetes control loop](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) mechanism and using [CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)

### How does it work ?

Crossplane transforms the Kubernetes cluster into a control plane to manage the resources in a declarative model. It comes with a set of components: [Provider](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/getting-started/introduction/#providers), [Composition](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/getting-started/introduction/#compositions), [Composite Resources](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/getting-started/introduction/#composite-resources), [Composite Resource Definitions](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/getting-started/introduction/#composite-resource-definitions), and [Claims](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/getting-started/introduction/#claims) as [CRDs](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/crossplane/crossplane), using these components in Crossplane, resources can be managed by directly calling their APIs.

### How does it differ from tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) or [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) ?

**Language and Syntax:**

- Crossplane â€” Uses kubernetes YAML manifests file

- Terraform â€” Uses a domain-specific language called HCL

- Pulumi â€” Uses general-purpose programming languages and YAML

**Approach:**

**Declarative** - defining a desired state rather than the steps to reach that desired solution. **Imperative** â€” define the steps to execute in order to reach the desired solution.

- Crossplane â€” Uses declarative approach

- Terraform â€” Uses declarative approach

- Pulumi â€” Uses [declarative & imperative](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-is-imperative-declarative-imperative/) approach

**State Management:**

It is a process of keeping track of the current state of the infrastructure resources and how to handle drift.

- [Crossplane ](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/pods/#reconcile-loop) â€” Relies on Kubernetes control loop, allowing it to respond immediately to changes (drift), by continuously reconciling

- [Terraform ](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/detecting-and-managing-drift-with-terraform)â€” Manages the state in a state file. Commands like terraform plan to generate a plan/view the changes and terraform apply to apply changes

- [Pulumi ](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/drift/)â€” Manages the state in a state file. Commands likepulumi preview to generate a plan/view the changes andpulumi up to apply changes

## Getting Started:

### i) Installing Crossplane:

Using the [Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/crossplane/crossplane), add the Crossplane repo and install the Helm chart in a new namespace.

```sh
# Add the repo
helm repo add crossplane-stable https://charts.crossplane.io/stable

# Update local cache
helm repo update

# Install crossplane
helm install crossplane \
--namespace crossplane-system \
--create-namespace crossplane-stable/crossplane
```

Verify the Crossplane installed components in the cluster by running the following command

```sh
âžœ  ~ k get all -n crossplane-system
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/crossplane-b5bd69bfd-wlb2q                 1/1     Running   0          20m
pod/crossplane-rbac-manager-684b78c8c8-c559f   1/1     Running   0          20m

NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/crossplane-webhooks   ClusterIP   10.106.50.79   <none>        9443/TCP   20m

NAME                                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/crossplane                1/1     1            1           20m
deployment.apps/crossplane-rbac-manager   1/1     1            1           20m

NAME                                                 DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/crossplane-b5bd69bfd                 1         1         1       20m
replicaset.apps/crossplane-rbac-manager-684b78c8c8   1         1         1       20m
```

### ii) Configuring AWS providers:

Providers enable Crossplane to provision infrastructure on an external service. In this example, the [AWS S3 provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-aws-s3/v1.5.0) is used. Run the kubernetes apply -f provider.yml to create a [Provider](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/providers/) object in the k8s cluster.

```yml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-aws-s3
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/provider-aws-s3:v1.5.0
```

To create resources in AWS, need to authenticate to AWS. First, you need to create Secrets from the credentials.

```sh
kubectl create secret generic aws-secret \
    -n crossplane-system \
    --from-file=creds=/root/.aws/credentials
```

And then reference the secrets in ProviderConfig to establish the connection to AWS. Run the kubernetes apply -f provider-config.yml to create a [ProviderConfig](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/providers/#provider-configuration) object in the k8s cluster.

```yml
apiVersion: aws.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  credentials:
  source: Secret
  secretRef:
    namespace: crossplane-system
    name: aws-secret
    key: creds
```

### iii) Create S3 bucket

It is time to create an S3 bucket in AWS, execute the commandkubernetes apply -f s3-bucket.yml

```yml
apiVersion: s3.aws.upbound.io/v1beta1
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: mk-crossplane-test-bucket
  labels:
  testing.upbound.io/example-name: s3
spec:
  forProvider:
  region: us-east-1
  tags:
    env: test
```

Go to the AWS console, and select the S3 service. And verify the s3 bucket named mk-crossplane-test-bucket is created.

To verify the drift correction process delete the s3 bucket in the AWS console. Wait for some time and observe that the bucket is being re-created.
