An apex domain is also known as root domain. Refers to the highest level of a domain name in DNS hierarchy. For example, `madhan.app` is the domain you have purchased, it is called domain apex and "root" of the hierarchy of domain names. All other considered as sub domains(eg: `www.madhan.app`, `blog.madhan.app`, ..etc)
